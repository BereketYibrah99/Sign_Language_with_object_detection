# 🧠 Sign Language Recognition using YOLOv8 Fine-Tuning

This project uses fine-tuned **YOLOv8** object detection to recognize English alphabet sign language gestures. By training YOLOv8 on a custom dataset of hand signs, the model detects and classifies hand poses corresponding to ASL letters in real-time.
